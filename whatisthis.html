  <h3>What is this?</h3>
  <p>On the Scratch Discussion forums, the link to change your signature is based on your username. Therefore, you can't provide a link that <b>anyone</b> can use to change their signature.</p>
<p>Send them here and they'll simply enter their username to be taken to the right place.</p>
