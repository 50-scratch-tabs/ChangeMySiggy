<h1>Change my Scratch siggy</h1>
<h2>Use this as a link for anyone to change their signature!</h2>
<p>On Scratch, the link to change your signature is based on your username. Therefore, you can't provide a link that anyone can use to change their signature.</p>
<p>Send them here and they'll simply enter their username to be taken to the right place.</p>
<input type="text" id="user" placeholder="Scratch Username"><br><button onclick="run();">Change my signature</button>
<script>
  function run(){
    location.href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/settings/"+document.getElementById("user").value;
